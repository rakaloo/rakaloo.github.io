<p>You can find a much better Bob's Burger's fan site located <a href="http://bobs-burgers.wikia.com/wiki/Bob%27s_Burgers_Wiki">here</a>.  In addition to featuring more content, the wikia webpage generally has a more cohesive and pleasing look. It includes an interactive menu bar and a sidebar with extra content. The code includes a fair amount of JavaScript, though I am not quite sure what it is doing yet.</p>
