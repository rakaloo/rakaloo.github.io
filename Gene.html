<h2>Favorite Gene quotes:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I'm not afraid of ghosts / I'm not afraid of sharks / I'm not afraid of cancer / I'm just afraid of snakes! / They really creep me out / Where are their arms and legs? / It's really not okay! </li>
	<li>Let's release the lobster back into the supermarket from whence it came.</li>
	<li>Soda, you made me fat, but you also made me strong.</li>
</ul>
